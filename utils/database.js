// In this step we are going to create javascript functions that allow us to get data from our database Programmatically
//
// 1. Please create a function getArtists() that perform a SQL query to our database and return an array of artists

}

// After task is complete
// - add the following code to "scripts" in package.json
//    "heroku-postbuild": "pnpm migrate up && pnpm build",
// - after that move to pages/index.js file again and scroll until the end of that file for the step 4 instructions.
